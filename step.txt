ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Upload and Extract Dataset
Upload the GTZAN ZIP file (or folder containing .au files organized by genre).
Extract all files to a working directory in Colab.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Feature Extraction Loop through .au files.
Extract features using librosa (e.g., MFCCs).
Store features and labels (genre) in a pandas DataFrame.
(Optional) Save the features as a .csv file for quick reuse.

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Load Data for ML
If CSV exists, load it; else use the extracted DataFrame.
Separate features (X) and labels (y).
Encode the genre labels.

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Train/Test Split
Split the dataset into training and test sets using train_test_split.

ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Build ML Pipelines
Use Pipeline from sklearn to chain:
StandardScaler for normalization
ML classifier (Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest)

ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Train Models
Fit models on the training data.

ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Evaluate Models
Predict on test data.
Show accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix (with seaborn heatmap).

ðŸ”¹ Step 8: Ensemble Method (VotingClassifier)
Combine models in a VotingClassifier and evaluate.

ðŸ”¹ Step 9: Save Best Model
Use joblib to save the trained model for future deployment.

ðŸ”¹ Step 10: Deploy Interface (Later)
Use Gradio or Streamlit to create a simple web interface (not covered now).
